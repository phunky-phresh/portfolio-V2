    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I’m a recent Software Engineering Immersive Graduate from General Assembly, Sydney. After completing my Bachelor of Creative Arts: Graphic Design degree, i’ve spent time working in a range of industries both in Australia and abroad.

    I consistently aim to improve on my own ability and skills while maintaining effective communication with colleagues and clients. I take pride in delivering my best and being a reliable employee. I’m excited to see what new opportunities become available in Software Engineering as i do enjoy designing, but to deliver a finished, interactive product is my true passion.</p>
